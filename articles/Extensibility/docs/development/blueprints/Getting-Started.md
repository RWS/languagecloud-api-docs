# Getting Started with Blueprints

Although you can start your app development from scratch, to help developers, we provide blueprints that have all the required components already included out of the box. Blueprints are available for .NET and Java.

Can you develop an app without using the blueprints? Definitely! But how nice is it to have a base app up and running within an hour, then write all that boilerplate yourself?

## What the blueprints provide

There is boilerplate to get an app service up and running in minutes, most notable being:
- Authentication is already implemented.
- Standard endpoints are implemented either completely or as stubs that need minimal code to be completed (for example: the health endpoint). 
- Models from the contract are already implemented.
- Database integration is provided with support for MongoDB. If a different database will be used, then only changes to the Data Access Layer need to be implemented.
- Dockerfile provided if you want to get started quickly with Docker.

## Getting the blueprints

The blueprints are available in our github repository: [https://github.com/RWS/language-cloud-extensibility](https://github.com/RWS/language-cloud-extensibility)

## Next steps

Once you decided that you want to start development using a blueprint and decided on the technology, follow the instructions on the page for that blueprint technology.
