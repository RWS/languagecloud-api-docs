# Publishing the App

The publish operation makes your app publicly available in the **RWS AppStore**, allowing other tenants to install and use it.

After registering, it is recommended that you install and test your app before publishing it to the store.

To publish your app you need to:
1. Test that it works as expected.
2. Select your app from the **My Apps** tab and click the **Publish** button. A comment box appears, this is where you can leave a message for the RWS support team (not mandatory).
3. Clicking **Publish** again will trigger the **Approval Process**.
4. The app will get in a pending state until someone from the support team approves or rejects the publish request. It shouldn't take long to get a response, as the support team is automatically notified when there are new requests.
5. After the support team approves your request, the app becomes publicly available in the **RWS AppStore**.
