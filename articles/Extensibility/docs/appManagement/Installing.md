# Installing the App

After the app is successfully registered, you can proceed to install it. The installation is tenant-based, which means that all users in the tenant will be able to use the app.

To install the app you need to:
1. Find your app in the **My Apps** tab and select the **Install** button.
2. When prompted with a form containing placeholders for the account settings details, remember that these are the configuration settings exposed through the [descriptor](../../App-API.v1.json/paths/~1descriptor/get). All mandatory fields will be marked with '*'.
3. Pay attention if the app advertises any [scopes](../../docs/development/Authentication-Overview.md), you will be notified by the installation form.

4. Fill in the fields and select **Complete**.
5. If the app supports validation of settings, it will be automatically performed at installation time via the [validation endpoint](../../App-API.v1.json/paths/~1configuration~1validation/post).
