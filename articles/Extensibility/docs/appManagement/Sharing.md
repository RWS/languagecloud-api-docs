# Sharing the App
By default, a newly registered app is private, meaning that only the developer tenant has access to it. However, you can share your app with other tenants even if it hasn't been published yet.

To share the app you need to:
1. Test that it works as expected.
2. Select your app from the **My Apps** tab and click the **Share** button.
3. You will receive a public link which you can share with other tenants. The link expires after **7 days**.
4. The link's recipient will then be able to access and install the app.

> The number of sharing links and shared installed instances is restricted by the sharing benefit quota from your account subscription.
