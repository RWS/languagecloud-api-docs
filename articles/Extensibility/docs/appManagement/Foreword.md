# Foreword

This section is about managing apps in RWS Trados and it is dedicated to developers.
 
Most of the features presented in these guides are **subscription-bound**, meaning that, depending on your account subscription, you may or may not benefit from them.

The management of the apps is only available to the account **administrators**.

Terms used throughout these guides include:
1. Developer (tenant) - the tenant from which the app was registered.
2. Consumers - the tenants where the app was installed.
3. RWS Support - an RWS Trados internal support team dedicated to helping out with the apps management processes.
