    "keywords": "RWS Language Cloud Extensibility RWS Language Cloud can be extended in a number of ways. You may want to create an add-on to support for a new machine translation engine or you may want to create a custom workflow task. When these requirements are identified, you can use the Extensibility Framework to augment the functionality of RWS Language Cloud. Pre-requisites An add-on is a REST API service that is hosted by the developer; add-ons are not hosted on RWS Language Cloud. You must therefore have the capability to host the add-on. Add-ons can currently be created using either .NET or Java so you will need development resources who are proficient in these environments. More Information Once you are ready to start developing your add-on, get in touch with RWS and we can make sure that you have a sandbox environment for development and testing. We will also point you in the right direction for the documentation and some add-on blueprints."

    "keywords": "RWS Language Cloud Public API The RWS Language Cloud Public API enables external applications to interact with RWS Language Cloud. Product Configurations This applies to all products that are based on RWS Language Cloud, including, but not limited to, Trados Enterprise, Trados Live Team and Trados Live Essential. Note that, depending on the product and specific product configuration, certain functionaly may not be available or the rate might be limited through the API . In general, when certain functionality is available in your specific product configuration, the corresponding endpoints will also be available in the API . Functionality Overview At present, the public API contains mainly functionality that enables the creation, management and tracking of cloud translation projects. Any other resources, such as project templates, pricing models or translation memories, need to be set up beforehand through the user interface. Rich terminology management is also available through the API , as can be witnessed by the tight integration available with Kaleidoscope Kalcium Quickterm. Types of Integrations At the moment, the RWS Language Cloud API can be called by custom (integration) applications on behalf of service users (non-human users). The ability to call the API on behalf of real end users will be supported at a later point. Where to find the API Documentation The API documentation is currently hosted here - RWS Language Cloud Public API What's New The API documentation has a dedicated section where you can find out more about the recent additions here - What's New Deprecated Features Now and again, we need to make changes to the RWS Language Cloud Public API which can impact existing integrations and add-ons. We try to provide as much notice as possible when we do this. You can find a list of deprecated features in the API documentation here - What's Deprecated Reporting Issues If you want to report an issue with the Public API, you can find information on how to do this here - How to report an issue"
