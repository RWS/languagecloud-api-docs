# Access the Var:ProductName APIs
Var:ProductName is the platform on which RWS host a number of products. You're in the right place if you're looking for API documentation for any of the following:
- Trados Enterprise
- Trados Accelerate
- Trados Team
- Trados Ignite
- Trados Studio (cloud capabilities)
- Trados Go

## Integrating with <Var:ProductName> products
To create an integration with any of the products listed above, you'll need to use the Public API. You can find the documentation for the API [here](articles/LCPublicAPI/docs/Introduction.md). Note that the API is updated regularly so make sure that you check out the [What's new](articles/LCPublicAPI/docs/Whats-New.md) section to find out information on recently added features. To enable RWS to extend and improve the API, and to support the latest features in the products, sometimes it's necessary to remove or change functionality. For that, you'll need to check the [What's deprecated](articles/LCPublicAPI/docs/Whats-Deprecated.md) page where RWS will post advance notice of any API endpoints that will be removed or change in the future. Don't worry though because RWS will try and give six months notice of any breaking changes.

## Extending <Var:ProductName> products
<Var:ProductName> products can be extended in a number of ways. For example, you may want to create an add-on to support a machine translation engine or you may want to create a custom workflow task. RWS provides an extensibility framework for the <Var:ProductName> suite of products. To get more information on what's required and how you can do this, visit the [<Var:ProductName> extensibility documentation](articles/Extensibility/) pages.

## Interacting with files
Translatable content in <Var:ProductName> is held in a format called **Bilingual Content Model**, or **BCM** for short. You can find **BCM** reference documentation and samples on this site. Click [here](articles/BCM/BCM.NET_client_API.md) to find out more.

## Reporting API issues ##

## Trados Cloud API and Customer Portal API
Please be aware that Trados Cloud offers two different APIs. First is the modern Trados Cloud API described on this page. Then there is the second API that is the <a href="https://languagecloud.sdl.com/cp/api" target="_blank">Mantra API</a>. Trados Cloud API is the recommended option for new integrations as it is more modern and much effort is put into its continuous evolution along with Trados Enterprise. Please take care not to confuse the two of them as they are not interchangeable.
