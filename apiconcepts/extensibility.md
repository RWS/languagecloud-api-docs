# RWS Language Cloud Extensibility #
RWS Language Cloud can be extended in a number of ways. You may want to create an add-on to support for a new machine translation engine or you may want to create a custom workflow task. When these requirements are identified, you can use the Extensibility Framework to augment the functionality of RWS Language Cloud.

## Pre-requisites ##
An add-on is a REST API service that is hosted by the developer; add-ons are not hosted on RWS Language Cloud. You must therefore have the capability to host the add-on. Add-ons can currently be created using either .NET or Java so you will need development resources who are proficient in these environments.

## More Information ##
Once you are ready to start developing your add-on, get in touch with RWS and we can make sure that you have a sandbox environment for development and testing. We will also point you in the right direction for the documentation and some add-on blueprints.
